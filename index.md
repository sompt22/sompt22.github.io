## Abstract

Multi object tracking (MOT) has been dominated by track by detection paradigm due to the success of one-shot object detectors in the last decade. As the datasets and bench-marking sites are published, research direction has shifted towards yielding best accuracy on the given scenarios including re-identification of objects while tracking. In this study, we narrow the use of MOT for surveillance by providing a dedicated dataset and focus on in-depth analyses of well performing four multi-object trackers to observe the weak and strong sides of state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for real-world applications. For this purpose, we introduce \textit{SOMOT22}, a new set of multi person tracking data with annotated short video shots captured from static cameras located on poles with 6-8 meter height positioned for city surveillance. This provides a more focused and specified bench-marking of MOT for outdoor surveillance compared to public MOT datasets. We analyze MOT trackers as single shot and multi-shot with respect to use of detection and re-identification networks. The experimental results on our new dataset indicates that SOTA is still far from high efficiency and single shot trackers are good candidates for unifying fast execution and accuracy with competitive performance.
